# RouteLLM-Pro

A cost-aware, multi-tier LLM routing system that classifies incoming queries by complexity and routes each to the cheapest capable model.

Live demo: https://routellm-pro.onrender.com/docs
Dashboard: https://routellm-pro.onrender.com/dashboard

(Free tier hosting spins down after ~15 min idle; first request after that takes 30-60s.)

## Architecture

Query -> Classifier -> Router -> Model Tier -> Response -> Redis Log -> Dashboard

Tiers:
- Small: Groq llama-3.1-8b-instant (simple queries)
- Mid: Groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile (reasoning, bounded coding tasks)
- Frontier: Gemini flash-latest (open-ended theoretical reasoning)

## Results (n=9, initial dataset)

- 73.3% cost reduction vs always-frontier baseline
- Tier split: 56% small, 33% mid, 11% frontier

## Tech Stack

FastAPI, Groq, Google Gemini, Upstash Redis, Chart.js, Render
